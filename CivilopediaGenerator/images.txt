NEW METHOD FOR MAIN IMAGES

Main images are now pulled from the PNG sheets in the D:\temp\unpack directory.
There are some cases where a file may not be found. This will occur if the unpacker did not move a DDS file to a PNG in the unpack directory. When this happens, open the offending DDS file in Paint.NET and save it as a PNG to the D:\temp\unpack directory.
