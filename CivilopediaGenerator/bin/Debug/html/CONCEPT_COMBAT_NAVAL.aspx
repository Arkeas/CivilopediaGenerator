		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Like land units, there are military and non-military naval units, as well as ranged, and melee naval units. Work boats are destroyed when attacked by barbarians and other civs or city-states, and any "embarked" land units are weak, although they can absorb a hit or two.<br /><br />Ranged naval combat units may attack other naval units and any land units within range that they can see.<br /><br />Melee naval combat units may directly attack other naval units, as well as coastal cities. There are however certain late-era naval units that merit special attention: the carrier, missile cruiser and the submarines. For more detail, you can view these units by clicking the "Units" tab in the Civilopedia.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
