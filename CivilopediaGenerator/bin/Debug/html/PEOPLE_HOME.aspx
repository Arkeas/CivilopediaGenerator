										Time and again throughout history, there have arisen men and women who have profoundly changed the world around them - artists, scientists, generals, merchants and others, whose genius sets them head and shoulders above the rest. In this game such visionaries are called "Great People."<br /><br />There are five different kinds of great people in the game: Great Merchants, Great Artists, Great Scientists, Great Engineers, and Great Generals. Each has a special ability.<br /><br />Your civilization acquires Great People by constructing certain buildings and wonders, and then staffing them with "specialists", citizens from your cities who have given up working in the field or the mines. While specialists do not assist in gathering food, wealth or production for a city, they do greatly speed the arrival of Great People. Balancing the need for production and food and the desire for Great People is an important challenge of city management.
