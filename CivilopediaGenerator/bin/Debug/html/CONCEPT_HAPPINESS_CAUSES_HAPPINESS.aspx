These include the Colosseum, the Circus, the Theatre, and others. Each building constructed anywhere in your civ increases your overall happiness (so two Colosseums produce twice as much happiness as one, unlike Luxuries).<br /><br />Wonders: Certain wonders like Notre Dame and the Prora can give you a big boost in happiness.<br /><br />Social Policies: While no single branch focuses on happiness, there are a few policies in each branch which either boost happiness or reduce unhappiness.<br /><br />Technologies: Technologies in themselves don't provide happiness, but they do unlock the buildings, wonders, resources and social policies which do.<br /><br />Religion: Certain religious beliefs provide happiness, as do certain religious buildings that can be purchased with <img src="/civilopedia/images/peace.png" alt="peace" /> Faith.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
