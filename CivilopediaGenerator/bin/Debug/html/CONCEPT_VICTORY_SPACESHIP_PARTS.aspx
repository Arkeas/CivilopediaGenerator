        Spaceship parts are constructed and move around the map like any other vehicle. Each requires an advanced technology to construct. They are non-combat units and are automatically destroyed if captured. Once a part has been constructed, order it to move to your current capital. When it arrives you'll be asked if you want to add it to your spaceship.<br /><br />When all spaceship parts have been added, the ship will launch into space and you will have won a science victory!<br /><br />Incidentally, spaceship parts cannot be rushed or purchased. They must be constructed in a city.
