        The world is a big place, and you don't always know what's going on everywhere. Early civilizations certainly didn't have any idea what the people on the other side of the mountains looked like until they sent out explorers; unless they put out sentries, they might not know that an enemy was massing a huge army just outside of their own borders. In Civilization V, until you explore the world, it's hidden in the "fog of war."<br /><br />The fog of war is represented by the white clouds that cover much of the world at the start of the game. As you move units around, the fog of war will pull back, revealing more of the world. Once you have uncovered the fog of war from a tile, it doesn't come back. However, if a unit moves and you can no longer see a tile, you won't know if anything is going on there.
