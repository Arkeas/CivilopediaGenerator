        When a civilization has advanced technologically enough to be able to support citizens who are not directly involved in providing food, those citizens can be assigned as "specialists." Specialists can increase a city's output of culture, gold, science or production. In addition, specialists speed the creation of "Great People."<br /><br />Great People are the artists, merchants, engineers, scientists and warriors who can, singlehandedly, change the course of a civilization. They're people like Leonardo Da Vinci, Andrew Carnegie, Louis Pasteur, and Robert E. Lee. Great People are extremely powerful. Great People are cool.
