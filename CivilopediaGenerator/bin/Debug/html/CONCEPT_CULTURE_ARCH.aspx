These are locations that note real events from earlier in your game, like battles that took place on a particular hex, or perhaps a Barbarian camp. To take advantage of these sites, you will need to construct an "Archaeologist" that can extract an Artifact from the site, or build a Landmark.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
