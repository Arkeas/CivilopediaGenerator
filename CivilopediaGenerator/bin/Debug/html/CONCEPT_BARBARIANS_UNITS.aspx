        Barbarian encampments can create almost any kind of unit in the game - from warriors and spearmen to cannon and tanks. (They can build units equal to those that the most advanced civilization can create.)<br /><br />Once created the barbarian units will either hang around their encampment or head off toward the nearest civilization or city-state and try to cause trouble. They'll attack units, destroy improvements and menace cities. If enough are involved, they can take down a poorly-defended city, which is then thoroughly pillaged. A pillaged city may lose gold, buildings and population.<br /><br />This is why it's important to periodically sweep the countryside around your civilization, destroying encampments before they become a threat.
