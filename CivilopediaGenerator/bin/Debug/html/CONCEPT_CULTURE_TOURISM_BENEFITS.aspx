The more <img src="/civilopedia/images/tourism.png" alt="tourism" /> Tourism you generate, the greater your Influence becomes with other civilizations (you can view your progress in the "Influence by Player" tab of the "Cultural Overview"). Once you've reach the "Familiar" level with another civilization, you will start receiving bonuses that grow as your Influence grows. These include additional <img src="/civilopedia/images/research.png" alt="research" /> Science from Trade Routes, more effective [ICON_SPY] Spies, and easier control of conquered cities (less unrest, and more population remaining).<br /><br />Ideology choices are also affected. If another civilization has chosen a different Ideology than your civilization, gaining Influence over their people will cause unhappiness within their civilization, forcing them to either cope with their unhappy people, or change Ideologies. For more information, see the "Social Policies" Game Concepts section, and click on "Ideologies".</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
