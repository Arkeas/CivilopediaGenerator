        If you make the conquered city a puppet, you gain the benefit of the city's research and its output of gold, while taking a much smaller hit to your citizens' happiness. However, you do not control the city's production. It makes the buildings it chooses and it creates no new units or wonders at all. Thus you'll have to provide the military force for its defense, and if you want to make the city more efficient, you'll have to order your civ's Workers to improve its land.  You can annex a puppet city at any time. To do so, click on the city's banner.
