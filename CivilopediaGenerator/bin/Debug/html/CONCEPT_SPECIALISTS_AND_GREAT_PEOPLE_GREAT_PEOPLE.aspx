The first six types are quite similar in functionality, each having abilities related to their areas of expertise, while Great Generals, Great Admirals, and Great Prophets are rather different: they are generated differently and they have different effects upon play. Great Generals and Great Admirals provide bonuses related to land and naval combat, and Great Prophets allow you to found a religion.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
