        Remember that a citizen working in a tile is generating something for the city - it may be food, production, gold, culture, or science. Once that citizen is assigned as a specialist,  he or she will not be working the tile, and whatever he or she was producing will be lost. Therefore it's a good idea to check your city's food, gold and production generation after creating specialists.
