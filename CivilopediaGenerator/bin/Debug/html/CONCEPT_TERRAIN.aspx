        In Civilization V, the world is made up of hexagonally-shaped "tiles" (also occasionally known as hexes and spaces). These tiles come in a variety of "terrain-types" - desert, plains, grassland, hills and so forth - and many also include "features" like forests and jungle. These elements help to determine the tile's usefulness to a nearby city as well as how easy or difficult it is to move through the tile. A tile's terrain and features may have important effects upon any combat occurring there.
