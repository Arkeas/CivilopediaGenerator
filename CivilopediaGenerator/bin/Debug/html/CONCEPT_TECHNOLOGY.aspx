        Technology is one of the driving forces behind civilization. It was advances in the technologies of agriculture and fishing that allowed cities to grow and thrive. It was advances in weaponry and masonry that allowed some cities to drive off the jealous barbarians who sought to steal their food and plunder their wealth. It was advances in medicine and sanitation that fought off the other great threat to civilization - disease.<br />Advancing technology makes a civilization stronger, bigger, smarter and a much tougher opponent. It is critically important for a civilization to keep up technologically with its neighbors. Everything else being more or less equal, it is possible for a backwards civilization to overcome a more advanced neighbor, but it's pretty difficult to think of any examples of this occurring in history.
