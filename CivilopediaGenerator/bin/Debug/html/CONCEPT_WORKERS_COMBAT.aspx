		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Workers are non-military units. They are captured when an enemy unit enters their tile, and they can be damaged by ranged attacks as well (they heal like other units, but they do not gain experience or receive promotions). Workers cannot attack or damage any other unit. It's a really good idea to stack a military unit with a worker if it's in dangerous territory. </div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
