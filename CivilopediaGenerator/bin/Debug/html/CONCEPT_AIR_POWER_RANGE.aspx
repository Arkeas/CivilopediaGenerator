        In place of a movement stat, air units have "range." This is the distance from a base that they can perform "missions." It's also the distance that they can "rebase" - move from one base to another. For example, a fighter unit has a range of 8. It can perform its missions against any tile within 8 spaces of its current base, and it can move to another player owned base (city or carrier) that is within 8 spaces as well.<br /><br />An air unit that rebases cannot perform another mission in the same turn.
