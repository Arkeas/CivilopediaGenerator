        The first nuclear weapon available in the game, the atomic bomb is a very powerful unit that can quickly alter the world's balance of power. Atomic bombs are similar to missiles in that they may only attack once. Unlike missiles, they may be stationed on aircraft carriers. The damage radius for the atomic bomb is 2 tiles in every direction. Units caught in the blast will be damaged, and cities will lose population if hit.<br /><br />An "A-bomb" cannot totally destroy a city. No matter how many times a city is hit by atomic bombs, it will not be destroyed.
