        Periodically, a city-state may announce a "mission" - perhaps it's being plagued by barbarians, for example, or its people seek knowledge of Natural Wonders, or perhaps they're being attacked by another civilization and they seek allies.<br /><br />If you complete the mission before another civ does so, you'll earn Influence Points with the city-state.
