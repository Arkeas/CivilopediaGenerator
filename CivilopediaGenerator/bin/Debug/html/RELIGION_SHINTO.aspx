		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">With no founding figure, and no central doctrine, Shinto is a spiritual belief of the Japanese people based on an individual's connection to the world, and to Japan itself. One of the central aspects of Shintoism is the worship of spirits, known as Kami, who are acknowledged through the visiting of shrines. Although the Kami are not considered gods, they are spirits or entities with close ties to humans, and they can have a beneficial effect on the course of one's existence. However, Shinto is not focused on the belief in Kami, but on the ritual of devotion itself. By paying your respects to the Kami at shrines, you are showing your interest and as such the Kami may bring positive benefits to your life. Although Shinto has been central to Japanese life for centuries, with over 100 million adherents found in Japan today, Shinto is not a religion in the traditional sense, but an ingrained faith unique to the Japanese people.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
