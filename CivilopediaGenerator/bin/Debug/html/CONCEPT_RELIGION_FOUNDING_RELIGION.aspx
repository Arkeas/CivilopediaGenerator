		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Once you have a Great Prophet and have previously founded a Pantheon you can use the Great Prophet to found a full Religion. This is done by selecting the Great Prophet (make sure he is located in a city), and clicking the "Found Religion" icon on the Unit Panel. You will now be presented with options to choose what sort of Religion you would like for your civilization. Select a symbol and name for your Religion, as well as Founder and Follower Beliefs, which determine what benefits will be awarded. You confirm those choices by clicking on the <img src="/civilopedia/images/religion.png" alt="religion" /> Found Religion button in the lower right of the selection screen.<br /><br />There is a limit of how many Religions can be founded in any game, and it's based on map size. That limit will always be lower than the default number of Civilizations in that game, so not everyone gets to found their own Religion.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
