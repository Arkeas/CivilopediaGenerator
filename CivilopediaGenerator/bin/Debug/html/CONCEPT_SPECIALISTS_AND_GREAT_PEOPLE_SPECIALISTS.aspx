        When a city is first created, all of its citizens (population) will work the tiles around the city, generating food, production, gold, etc. Later on, you can construct certain buildings which allow you to reassign some of the citizens to work in the building as specialists.<br /><br />For example, the University has 2 "slots" for "scientist" specialists. Once you've constructed a University in a city, you can assign 1 or 2 citizens to work in that University as scientists. (Note that not all buildings create specialists; see the Buildings section in the Civilopedia.)<br /><br />There are four different classes of specialists. The type a citizen becomes depends upon the type of building he is assigned to work in.
