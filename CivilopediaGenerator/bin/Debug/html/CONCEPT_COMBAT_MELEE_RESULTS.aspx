        At the end of melee combat, one or both units may have sustained damage and lost "hit points." If a unit's hit points are reduced to 0, that unit is destroyed. If after melee combat the defending unit has been destroyed and the attacker survives, the attacking unit moves into the defender's hex, capturing any non-military units in that hex. If the defending unit survives, it retains possession of its hex and any other units in the hex.<br /><br />Most units use up all of their movement when attacking. Some however have the ability to move after combat - if they survive the battle and have movement points left to expend.<br /><br />Any surviving units involved in the combat will receive "experience points" (XPs), which may be expended to give the unit promotions.
