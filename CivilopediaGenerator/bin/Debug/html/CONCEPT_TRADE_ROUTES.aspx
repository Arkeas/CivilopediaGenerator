		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Trade Routes are established between two cities of different civilizations, providing Gold to each every turn. The civilization that the Trade Route originates from gets a larger sum of Gold than the destination civilization. The amount of Gold a Trade Route produces is dependent upon the resource diversity and revenue of the origin city.<br /><br />Trade Routes can also be created between two cities of the same civilization. Once the origin city has a Granary, it can send Food to the destination city, and once it has a Workshop it can send Production. These types of internal Trade Routes do not benefit the origin city.<br /><br />You can only have a limited number of Trade Routes at any time. Researching certain technologies increases the number of routes you have available. For details about your existing Trade Routes, open the Trade Route Overview screen, located in the Additional Information drop-down menu.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
