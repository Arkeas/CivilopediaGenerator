        Workers can construct roads once their civilization has acquired the wheel technology. Roads can be constructed in friendly, neutral or enemy territory. They can be built in any terrain and across any features, except for mountains, Natural Wonders and ice (and of course they can't be built in water tiles). Roads can be constructed in tiles with resources and/or improvements.  See the section on roads for more details.
