        Luxury resources increase your civilization's happiness and provide a small bonus to the hex's output. Only one source of a specific luxury provides a happiness bonus. Multiple sources of the same resource do not further increase a civ's happiness (however, they're still valuable since they can be traded to other civs). You do get increased happiness bonuses for each type of luxury resource you possess, though.<br />In other words, if your civilization has 1 or 2 silk, you get the same happiness bonus, but you'd double the bonus if you traded the second silk to another civ in return for sugar.
