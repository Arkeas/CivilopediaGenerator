This is achieved through Tourism generated by Great Works that you create, and artifacts that you discover. The Tourism you generate has a constant impact on other civilizations, and its effect is amplified through Open Borders, Trade Routes, shared Religion and Ideologies, Research Agreements, etc.<br /><br />When your cumulative Tourism output (for the entire game) surpasses the cumulative Culture output of each remaining civilization in the game, you win the Culture Victory.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
