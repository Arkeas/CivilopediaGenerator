        When two units engage in melee combat, the result is determined by relative strengths of the two units - e.g., if a powerful unit fights a weak one, the powerful unit is likely to do a lot more damage to its enemy, possibly destroying it altogether.<br /><br />However many different factors may affect a unit's strength in battle. Many units receive "defensive bonuses" that will increase their melee strength when they are attacked while occupying forests or hills, or are fortified. Some units get bonuses when fighting other specific unit types (spearmen get bonuses when fighting mounted units, for example). Also, a unit's injuries may reduce its current combat strength. (See the section on Combat Bonuses for details.)<br /><br />The Combat Information Table will help you determine the relative strengths of two melee units during your turn.
