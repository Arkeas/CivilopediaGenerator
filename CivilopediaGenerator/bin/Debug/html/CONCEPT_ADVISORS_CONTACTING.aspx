You can follow these links or click "Thank You" at any time to dismiss the Advisor.<br /><br />You can also press the "Additional Information" button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen to reach the "Advisor Counsel" screen. There you can see all four of your Advisors; if they have anything useful to say on the current situation it will appear there.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
