		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">To take advantage of an Antiquity Site, you must first build an Archaeologist. Archaeologists are units that can only be constructed in a city with a University. Once built, send him to any Antiquity Site (Open Borders are required for other civilizations), and once they arrive, select the "Construct Archaeological Dig" option on the Unit panel. After a set number of turns, you will have the option to either extract an Artifact, or create a Landmark.<br /><br />If you complete the Exploration Social Policy tree, you will also reveal Hidden Antiquity Sites. These special Antiquity sites not only yield up Artifacts like regular Antiquity Sites, but there is also a chance you will find a special Great Work of Writing Artifact, like the Rosetta Stone. You can use this like a Great Work of Writing, or you can choose to start a Cultural Renaissance, which will grant you a large amount of Culture.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
