		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">You may choose to intimidate a city-state with the goal of asking for tribute. Tribute can be in the form of a worker, or a lump-sum of gold. One way to intimidate a city-state is through the size of your military in comparison to other powers, or by having military units close-by.<br /><br />If you would like to ask for tribute from a city-state, open the city-state diplomacy panel, and click the "Ask for Tribute" option. If the following options are red, then the city-state is not afraid of you, and will not give in to your demand. If you are successful, you will gain the tribute, but lose influence with the city-state.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
