        Any military unit may attack an enemy unit. Scout units can initiate combat and defend against enemy attacks, though they are weaker than other units. Non-military units such as workers, settlers, and great people may not initiate attacks. If attacked while on their own, workers and settlers are captured (captured settlers turn into workers) and great people and work boats are destroyed.  A city may attack an enemy military unit that is within the city's Ranged Combat Range, and a unit may in turn attack an enemy city.
