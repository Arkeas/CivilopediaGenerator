        When you need to pick a new technology, the Choose Research menu appears on the left edge of the screen. At the top it displays the technology you've just finished learning (it displays "Agriculture" the first time it appears). Below that is the "Open Technology Tree" button (more about that later), and beneath that is a list of the technologies available to you at that time. Each technology displays the number of turns it will take you to get that tech, as well as icons representing the various buildings, improvements, wonders and so forth that the technology allows (or "unlocks"). You can hover your mouse atop an icon or technology to learn even more info about it.<br /><br />Click on a tech to choose to research that tech. The Choose Research menu will disappear, and a large icon will appear in the upper left-hand corner of the screen, showing you which tech you are currently researching and how long until completion.
