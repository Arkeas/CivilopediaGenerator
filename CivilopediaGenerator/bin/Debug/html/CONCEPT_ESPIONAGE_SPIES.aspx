		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">You will earn your first Spy when any civ in the game enters the Renaissance Era. Spies can be assigned to a city in another civilization with the goal of stealing technology and gathering information. You can also assign a Spy to one of your own cities to have a chance to slow down, discover, or kill an enemy spy.<br /><br />When assigning a Spy to the capital of another civilization, you can choose to assign them as a Diplomat. Diplomats do not steal technology, and are only there to gather information. Additionally, if the target civilization is following a different Ideology, your Diplomat will start spreading Propoganda, increasing your <img src="/civilopedia/images/tourism.png" alt="tourism" /> Tourism bonus in that civilization. Because they are a Diplomat, they are in no danger from other spies. They become even more useful when the World Congress is founded, delivering information on how other civilizations are planning to vote, and allowing votes to be traded via diplomacy.<br /><br />To deploy your first Spy or Diplomat, select "Espionage Overview" from within the "Additional Information" menu.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
