										Buildings can dramatically improve a city's wealth, population, defenses, or productivity. Certain buildings will improve the quality of some military units constructed there, while others will allow a coastal city to harvest food from the oceans.<br /><br />It's important to construct buildings. If your civilization is heavily involved in combat, the temptation may be to focus all of your production on military units, but if you pursue this pathway for too long, your cities may become inferior to other civs' better-developed cities, putting you at a significant disadvantage as the game progresses.
