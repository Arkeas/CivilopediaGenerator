        There are four main types of air units in Civilization V: helicopter gunships, missiles, fighters, and bombers. Helicopter gunships are the closest to standard ground combat units and will be discussed separately.<br /><br />Of the other air units, missiles are essentially "one-shot" weapons: you fire 'em, they hit their target and they're gone. Fighters are primarily used to defend against other air power and to clear the target of interceptors to allow bombers to hit their targets. Bombers do damage to targets on the ground, if not intercepted. Anti-air units defend against fighters and bombers.
