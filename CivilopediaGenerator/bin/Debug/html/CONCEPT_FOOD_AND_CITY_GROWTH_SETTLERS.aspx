        Settlers can only be constructed in cities of size 2 or larger. During construction, settlers consume a city's production and all of the city's excess food intake. As long as the settler is in production, the city will not grow or add food to its growth bucket. (Note that settlers don't subtract food from the bucket; they consume excess food being produced, stopping more food from going into that bucket.) See the section on Settlers for more details.
