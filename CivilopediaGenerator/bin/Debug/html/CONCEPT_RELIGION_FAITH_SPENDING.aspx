		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr"><img src="/civilopedia/images/peace.png" alt="peace" /> Faith can be spent in several ways. It can be used to purchase religious units or buildings or it will get expended to spawn a Great Prophet, or, once you enter the Industrial Era, another Great Person.<br /><br />The <img src="/civilopedia/images/peace.png" alt="peace" /> Faith you've accumulated will automatically be spent on spawning a Great Prophet once you've reached a certain threshold (to see this hover your mouse over the <img src="/civilopedia/images/peace.png" alt="peace" /> icon in the Status Bar). Once you enter the Industrial Era, you can spend Faith on other Great People as well, depending on which Social Policy branches you've unlocked.<br /><br />You can also choose to spend your accumulated <img src="/civilopedia/images/peace.png" alt="peace" /> Faith on Units or buildings. This can be done in the Purchase menu of the City Screen. Missionaries and Inquisitors are available in every city that follows a Religion while the respective buildings are only available if the Majority Religion contains a Belief that unlocks the purchase of a Religious Building.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
