										Some great things are only possible through international cooperation. History has seen many examples of nations coming together for mutual benefit and decision making, from the trade-focused Hanseatic League to the more recent League of Nations. The twentieth century saw a new level of international cooperation begin with the United Nations.<br /><br />In Civilization V, the "World Congress" represents these diplomatic interactions between multiple parties and acts as the path to Diplomatic Victory. In this diplomatic body, all civilizations have the chance to decide on game-changing effects in the form of "Resolutions." In addition, "International Projects" can be built, which combine the production efforts of multiple civilizations to benefit those who contribute.
