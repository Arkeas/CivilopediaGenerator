		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Pantheons are the first step towards founding a full Religion. Once you've accumulated a certain amount of <img src="/civilopedia/images/peace.png" alt="peace" /> Faith you will be able to select a Pantheon Belief. The Pantheon Belief you choose will be the basis for any later Religion you might found so choose wisely as it may stay with you for the whole game. The amount of <img src="/civilopedia/images/peace.png" alt="peace" /> Faith it takes to found a Pantheon will increase with every Pantheon that has been founded on the whole map.<br /><br />Pantheons are an early approach to Religion. Consequently it is only possible to found a Pantheon throughout the early ages depending on the developments of Religions around you. Once you've chosen your Pantheon Belief, it will immediately be available throughout your entire civilization, and will automatically expand to new cities until you found a full Religion.<br /><br />Note that players will no longer be able to found a new Pantheon if another player has already Enhanced their Religion, and the number of active Pantheons matches or exceeds the number of Religions allowable in the current game.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
