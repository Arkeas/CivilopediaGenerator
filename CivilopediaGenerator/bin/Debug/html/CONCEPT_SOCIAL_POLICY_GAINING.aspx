        You can choose to adopt and unlock a social policy once you have gained enough culture points: the first one becomes available once you acquire 50 culture points, with the subsequent ones costing a little bit more. The cost of each Policy increases the more you adopt. To see how much culture you currently have and when the next policy will become available, hover your mouse over the Culture icon on the Status Bar. You can read more about accruing culture in the Culture section.<br /><br />Once you have enough culture, a notification will alert you on your turn. Click on the Social Policies icon in the top right corner (located next to your advisors) to bring up the Social Policies Pane. If you don't wish to select a Policy that turn, you may right-click the notification to dismiss it. (The game will not remind you again though, so this can be risky.) Here you can choose to adopt a new branch or unlock a new policy within an unlocked branch. To view all the available policies (and not just the ones you've unlocked), click on the Advanced View toggle at the bottom of the pane.<br /><br />When you have acquired the requisite amount of culture, click on the "Adopt Policy" button to open up the chosen branch for exploration - you must first spend points to adopt the branch before unlocking any of the individual policies. Each branch adoption will give you some benefit immediately, with the individual policies within each providing more bonuses of the same nature.<br /><br />Some branches (like Autocracy and Freedom) may not be unlocked and active at the same time, and many branches only become available once a later era has been reached.
