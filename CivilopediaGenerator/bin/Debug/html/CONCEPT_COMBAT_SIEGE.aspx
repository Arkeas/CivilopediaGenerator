        Certain ranged weapons are classified as "siege weapons" - catapults, ballistae, trebuchets, and so forth. These units get combat bonuses when attacking enemy cities. They are extremely vulnerable to melee combat, and should be accompanied by melee units to fend off enemy assault.<br /><br />Most siege weapons have to be disassembled to move around the map. When they have reached their destination, they must expend a movement point to "set up." They cannot attack until they have done so.<br /><br />Siege weapons are important. It's really difficult to capture a well-defended city without them!
