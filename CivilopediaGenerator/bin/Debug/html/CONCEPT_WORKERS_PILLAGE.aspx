        Enemy units can "pillage" roads and improvements, rendering them temporarily useless - no resource, no movement bonus, and so forth. It is as if the worker never built the road or made the improvement.<br /><br />A unit may even pillage its own civilization's improvement (typically to deny it to another civilization who is about to capture the first civilization's city).<br />A unit that pillages an improvement may gain a gold bonus but will use one movement point.
