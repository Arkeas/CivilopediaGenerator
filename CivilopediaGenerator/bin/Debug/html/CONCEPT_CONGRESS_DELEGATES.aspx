		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Proposed resolutions to the Congress are decided through the use of delegates. Civilizations start with the same number of delegates, but they can gain more by allying with city-states and through certain resolutions. The amount of delegates each civilization controls will also increase as the game advances to later eras.<br /><br />Once a session of the Congress begins, civilizations divide their delegates as they like between proposed resolutions to support the outcomes they desire. Delegates support "Yea" in order to help pass the resolution, or "Nay" in order to help prevent it from passing. Some resolutions require choosing a civilization rather than simply "Yea" or "Nay".</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
