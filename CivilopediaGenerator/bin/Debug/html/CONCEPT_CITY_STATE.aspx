        City-States are the smaller political entities in Civilization V. They cannot win a game - they're not competing against you - but they can greatly assist or impede your progress towards victory. You can befriend City-States and gain a number of important benefits; you can ignore them and concentrate on bigger and more important foes; or you can conquer them and take their stuff. It's up to you.
