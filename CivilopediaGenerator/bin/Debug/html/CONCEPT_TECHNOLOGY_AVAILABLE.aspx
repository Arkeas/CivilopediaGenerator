        At the start of the game, there are just a few technologies available to research - generally Animal Husbandry, Archery, Pottery, and Mining. All of the other technologies in the game have one or more prerequisite techs that must be learned before they can be studied. When you've learned the prerequisite techs, the newly-available tech will appear on the Choose Research menu.<br /><br />For example, the techs of sailing, calendar, and writing require knowledge of pottery before they can be learned. So if you study Pottery, that tech will be removed from the Choose Research menu (because you already know it) and Sailing, Calendar and Writing will be added.<br /><br />Some technologies require knowledge of 2 or 3 prerequisite technologies, not just one. Those techs will not appear until you've learned both of the required techs.
