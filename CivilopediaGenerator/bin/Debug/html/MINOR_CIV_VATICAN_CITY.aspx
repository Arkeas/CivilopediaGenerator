		<h2>Historical Info:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">The walled Vatican city-state, officially established in 1929, serves as the epicenter for the Catholic Church and its millions of followers throughout the world today. Founded as a means of resolving the ongoing conflicts between the Pope and the Kingdom of Italy over land ownership and control of Rome, the Lateran Treaty laid the groundwork for an independently governed city-state within the boundaries of Rome itself. As the sovereign of Vatican City, the Pope is the only absolute monarch left in Europe, and he holds supreme authority over all branches of the Vatican's government. The city itself is known for the many incredible works of art housed in its museums and cathedrals. St. Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel are perhaps the best known sites within the Vatican, featuring works by Michelangelo, Raphael, and Botticelli.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
