		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Establishing an Embassy is one of the first diplomatic actions available after meeting another civilization, and is available upon researching Writing. Embassies are necessary for trading Open Borders or making Defensive Pacts or Research Agreements, and once set up, will also show you the location of an opposing player's capital. If you have Writing and the other player does not, you can still establish an Embassy in their civilization without reciprocating, although they may ask for a small sum of gold as compensation. Going to war will immediately close down opposing embassies.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
