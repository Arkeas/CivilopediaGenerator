		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Over time, you'll learn new technologies that will allow you to create better military units than those you previously could. When this occurs, you'll have the option to "upgrade" the older units, turning them into the newer, more powerful models. (For example, once you learn Iron  Working, you can upgrade any Warrior units you possess into Swordsmen.) Each upgrade costs some gold - the more powerful the upgrade, the more expensive it will be.<br /><br />A unit must be in your territory to be upgraded. When an upgrade is available for a unit, the "Upgrade" button will appear in the unit's Action list.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
