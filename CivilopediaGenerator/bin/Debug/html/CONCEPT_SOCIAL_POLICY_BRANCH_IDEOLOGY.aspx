		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">The three Ideology trees, Freedom, Order, and Autocracy, have greatly expanded in Brave New World. All civilizations in the game, upon reaching the Modern era or building three factories, will be required to choose an Ideology for their civilization. Each Ideology tree contains 3 tiers of "tenets" that you use to customize your Ideology, with the third and final tier holding the most powerful benefits. As with regular Social Policies, players use Culture to purchase additional tenets as they move through the game.<br /><br />Civilizations that share a common Ideology will receive benefits with their diplomatic relationships. Civilizations that have conflicting Ideologies have multiple side-effects. For example, a negative effect on their diplomatic relationship and happiness penalties take effect if an opposing Ideology has a stronger Cultural influence on your people. If you let your people become too unhappy, there is a chance that your cities may declare that they are joining your opponents empire. As a last resort, you, or other players, can resort to a "Revolution" to switch Ideologies to one that is preferable to your people.<br /><br />For more information on Ideological Tenets, click on the "Social Policies" tab along the top of the Civilopedia, and scroll down to the Order, Freedom, and Autocracy sections.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
