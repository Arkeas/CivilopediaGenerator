        As a city gains culture, it will acquire additional tiles in the surrounding unclaimed territory. The faster it gains culture, the faster its territory will grow.  Each city acquires territory depending upon its own cultural output. When it reaches a certain level, it will "claim" a new tile (if any are available).<br /><br />Check out the Status Box on the City Screen to see how much culture a city is producing each turn, and how long until the city grabs another tile. The amount of culture required to get a new tile increases as the city's territory grows.<br /><br />Note that you can also expend gold to "purchase" tiles; this is entirely independent of the city's own acquisition based upon its culture.
