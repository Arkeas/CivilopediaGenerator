        If you don't do anything, your IPs will tend to revert to zero over time: if your IPs are positive, they'll reduce by a small amount each turn. If they're negative, they'll increase by a small amount each turn. (The exact amount can vary based on the City-State's personality.) So if you want to maintain positive relations with a city-state, you'll have to periodically complete a mission or give them a gift.<br /><br />Note that you lose a handful of IPs per turn for each of your units "trespassing" in a city-state's territory. If you are friends with the city-state, you can move through its territory with no consequences.
