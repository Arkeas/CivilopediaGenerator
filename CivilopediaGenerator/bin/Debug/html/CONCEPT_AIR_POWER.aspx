        By the Second World War, air power has come to dominate warfare around the world. Air power acts as a "force multiplier" in combat, and the nation that can establish air supremacy over the battlefield has a huge advantage over the enemy.<br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, strategic bombing has become a central force in modern warfare, and with the advent of nuclear ballistic missiles, it has the ability to literally wipe an entire civilization off the face of the planet.<br /><br />Air power is critical to victory in Civilization V.
