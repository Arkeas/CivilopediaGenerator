		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Great People can move about the board like any other units. They are non-combat units, which means that they cannot stack in a tile with other non-combat units (Workers, Settlers), but they can stack with one military unit. If an enemy unit enters a Great Person's tile, that Great Person is automatically destroyed (the enemy doesn't get it.) The exception to this rule is the Great Prophet, which can be captured.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
