        If you destroy the city, it's gone. For good. All of its buildings, wonders, and citizens are no more. We hope you're proud of yourself, you big bully! While there are some good reasons for destroying a city, mostly to do with your population's happiness, this extreme behavior does have significant diplomatic consequences - i.e., other civs and city-states may be less likely to ally with you if they think you're a bloodthirsty maniac. You can destroy the city immediately upon capturing it or at any point after that.
