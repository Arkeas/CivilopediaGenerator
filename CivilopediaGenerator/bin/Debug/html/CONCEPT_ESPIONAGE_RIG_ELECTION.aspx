		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Spies can be used to increase your influence with City-States by "rigging" their local elections or staging a coup. To interact with a City-State, first move a spy to a target City-State. Once the spy arrives, there will be a period of time when they are "Establishing Surveillance" (noted in the "Activity" column). Once surveillance is established, your espionage options become available. Rigging an election, a passive ability, occurs every 15 turns while your spy is located within the City-State. If you are the only spy in the City-State, your influence will increase while everyone else's will drop. The presence of an enemy spy, especially one of a higher rank, can cause this mission to fail. No worries though, failing to rig an election is not dangerous to your spy.<br /><br />Staging a coup is more powerful than rigging an election, but also much riskier. A successful coup essentially allows you to "steal" the allied status from another civiization. To stage a coup, target a City-State that is allied with another player, and place your spy the same way you would with rigging an election. Once surveillance is established, you will have a new button available to you called "Coup". Clicking it will open a pop-up message that gives you your odds of success. The closer you are in influence to the target civilization, the greater your odds. The catch? If you fail, your spy is executed.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
