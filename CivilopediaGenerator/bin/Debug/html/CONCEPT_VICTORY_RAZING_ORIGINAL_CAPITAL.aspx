A capital cannot be destroyed by any means. It can be captured, but not destroyed. Dropping a nuke on the city will at worst reduce its population to 1, but the city will not be destroyed. Accept it and move on. (Remember that you can drive another civ out of the game by destroying or capturing all of its cities, so you can still wipe your foes off the map even if you can't erase their capital from the face of the earth...)</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
