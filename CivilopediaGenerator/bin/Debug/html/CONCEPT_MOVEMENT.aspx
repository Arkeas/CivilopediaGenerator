        During a game of Civilization V, much of your time will be spent moving units around the world. You'll be marching your military units off to discover stuff or to fight with your neighbors. Your workers will be moving to new tiles to improve stuff and to construct roads. Your settlers will be moving to good locations on which to build new cities.<br /><br />Following are rules for moving land units and naval units. Air units have their own special rules; since they don't occur until late in the game, they're covered elsewhere.
