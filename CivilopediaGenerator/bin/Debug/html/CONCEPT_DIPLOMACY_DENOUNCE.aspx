		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Players have the ability to publicly "Denounce" other Civs who have slighted them. However, there are diplomatic repercussions to consider and denunciations shouldn't be taken lightly.  A Civ you Denounce will be wary of any later attempts at diplomacy, and it will take years before they forget your actions. On the other hand, a carefully timed denunciation as a prelude to war could benefit you by drawing the other enemies of your target out of the woodwork and into the war as your allies. </div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
