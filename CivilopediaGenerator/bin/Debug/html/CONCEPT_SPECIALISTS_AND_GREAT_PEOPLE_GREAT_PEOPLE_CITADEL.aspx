		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Placing a Citadel gives you ownership of all adjacent tiles, as your Culture borders will expand to surround the Citadel. Additionally, the Citadel provides a big defensive bonus to any unit occupying it. Further, it damages any enemy unit that ends its turn next to the Citadel (damage does not stack with other Citadels). Note that a Citadel functions only when it's in your territory. If it were to change hands when a nearby city is conquered, it will only be effective for the new owner. If the new Culture border claims hexes already owned by another civilization, you will incur a diplomatic penalty as a result.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
