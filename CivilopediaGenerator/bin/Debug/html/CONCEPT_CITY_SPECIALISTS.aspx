        Specialists are citizens who have been assigned to work in a building constructed in their city. There are four kinds of specialists in Civilization V: Scientists, Merchants, Artists, and Engineers. A museum, for example, allows one or two citizens to be assigned to work in the building as Artist specialists. Not all buildings allow specialists to be assigned to them. See the individual building entries for details.
