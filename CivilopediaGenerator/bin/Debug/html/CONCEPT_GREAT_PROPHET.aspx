Once you've accumulated enough <img src="/civilopedia/images/peace.png" alt="peace" /> Faith (at least 200 in a standard speed game), you have a chance to spawn a Great Prophet. Once a Great Prophet appears, you can use their "Found Religion" ability to create your own custom religion. Like other Great People, the Great Prophet has other abilities as well, including constructing a special Improvement.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
