		<h2>Historical Info:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">As a policy, freedom generally means that no class of society is subservient to another, and that all are equally subject to the laws. I can't own you, and you can't take my wife from me simply because you're the king's son-in-law. Free societies are generally more successful than non-free states, as the free people often feel that they have more of a stake in their country's success or failure.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
