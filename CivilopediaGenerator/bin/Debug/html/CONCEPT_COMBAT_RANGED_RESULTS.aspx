        At the end of ranged combat, the target unit may have sustained no damage, some damage, or it may have been destroyed. Remember that the attacking unit will never suffer any damage during ranged combat (except possibly for air units). If the target is destroyed, the attacking unit does not automatically enter the now-vacant tile (which is what usually happens during melee combat), but you may of course send another unit into the empty space if you've got one with the movement points available.<br />The attacking and defending units may receive "experience points" (XPs) as a result of the combat. See the section on "Promotions" for details.
