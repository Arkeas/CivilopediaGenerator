        For early man, the forests were a great source of bounty, providing wood for fire, tools and shelter, and also many animals for sustenance and clothing. As a city grows there is a great temptation to cut down the forests for farmland, but a wise leader will always leave some standing - for productivity and to lift his people's spirits. Also, military units stationed in forests receive a significant defensive bonus.<br /><br />Remember that forest tiles' yield is always 1 food and 1 production, no matter the terrain type or if the tile is hilly.<br /><br />City Yield: 1 food, 1 production<br />Movement Cost: 2<br />Combat Modifier: 25% defensive bonus
