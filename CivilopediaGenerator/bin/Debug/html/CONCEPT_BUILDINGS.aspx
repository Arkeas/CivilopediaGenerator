        A city is more than a bunch of homes. It contains schools and libraries, markets and granaries, banks and barracks. Buildings represent the improvements and upgrades that you make in a city. Buildings can increase the city's rate of growth, can speed production, can increase the science of a city, can improve its defenses, and can do lots of other good things as well. See the Civilopedia Building section for more details on buildings.<br /><br />A city that has no buildings is pretty weak and primitive and will probably remain fairly small, while a city with a lot of buildings can indeed grow to dominate the world.
