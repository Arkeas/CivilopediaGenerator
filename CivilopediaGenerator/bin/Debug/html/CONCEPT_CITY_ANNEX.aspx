        If you annex the city, you make it a part of your empire. You have total control over the city, just as if you had constructed the city yourself. The one downside to annexation is that doing so makes your citizens very unhappy, and you will be required to construct happiness-related buildings like colosseums or connect up to luxury resources to counteract their extreme displeasure. Annexing too many cities too rapidly can bring your empire to a grinding halt.
