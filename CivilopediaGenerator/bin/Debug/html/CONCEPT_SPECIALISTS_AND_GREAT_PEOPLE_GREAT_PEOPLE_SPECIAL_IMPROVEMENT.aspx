        Each Great Person type can be expended to create a Special Improvement on a tile within your civilization's borders. The Special Improvement's effects depend upon which Great Person is creating it - a Great Artist's Special Improvement generates culture, for example, while a Great Merchant's generates cash.<br /><br />A Special Improvement must be worked in order to have any effect. Further, a Special Improvement can be pillaged and repaired like any other Improvement. If constructed atop a resource, the Special Improvement will only provide access to it if that resource is a strategic resource.<br /><br />Note that you have to move the Great Person out of the city and into your territory to construct a Special Improvement.
