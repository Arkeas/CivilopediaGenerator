		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">A session is when the civilizations of the World Congress decide on one or more proposed resolutions. There are two types of sessions: normal sessions and special sessions. Normal sessions happen on a regular basis, and they can be planned for. The time between these sessions will get shorter as the game goes on, but the number of turns until the session begins is always known.<br /><br />Special sessions are immediate sessions that happen when civilizations advance into later eras. Once half of the civilizations in the game reach the next appropriate era (or one civilization reaches the era after that), a special session is held which temporarily puts normal session activity on hold. Depending on which era was reached, the number of delegates for civilizations and city-state allies may increase. The only resolution to decide during this special session is who the next host of the World Congress will be. These are the only times that the Congress's host can change (unless the host is conquered, in which case the remaining civilization with the most delegates becomes the new host).</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
