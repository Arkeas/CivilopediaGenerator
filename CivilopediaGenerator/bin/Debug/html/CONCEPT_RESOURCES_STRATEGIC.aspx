        Strategic resources are not visible at the start of the game: they require knowledge of a particular technology before they appear on a map. Horses, for example, do not appear until you know animal husbandry, and iron doesn't show up until you learn iron working.<br /><br />Strategic resources allow you to build certain units and buildings. When you construct an improvement on a strategic resource hex, it provides you a limited number of those resources, and these are consumed when you construct the associated units or buildings. For example, you use one iron resource to build each swordsman unit. If you don't have one iron available, you can't construct the swordsman. The resource becomes available to you once more if the unit or building is destroyed. Should you lose access to the resource at any point, units that require that resource will receive a massive combat penalty until the resource is restored.<br /><br />You can trade strategic resources with other civilizations.<br /><br />You can see how many units of each strategic resources you have available on the top of the main screen.
