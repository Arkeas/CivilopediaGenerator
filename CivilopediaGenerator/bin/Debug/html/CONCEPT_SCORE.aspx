        In many Civilization V games, one of the players will win the game by achieving one of the four possible victories: Domination, Science, Diplomacy, or Culture. However, if no one achieves one of these victories by the year 2050, the winner is determined by the surviving civilization's "score."<br />And if someone does win outright before 2050, their score will determine their place on the "Hall of Fame" screen. Here's how scores are calculated.
