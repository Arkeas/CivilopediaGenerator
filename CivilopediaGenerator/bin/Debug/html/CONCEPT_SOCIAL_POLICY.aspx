		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Social Policies, and later, Ideologies, are branches of choices representing the way you choose to govern your people. Will you be an authoritarian ruler, sacrificing a little freedom for discipline and increased productivity? Will you organize your civilization to have a strong military, or will you concentrate your efforts on expanding culture and borders?  Do you want to set up your civ as a monarchy or democracy? There are many different branches to choose from, each headlining a specific aspect of government.<br /><br />Social policies and Ideologies have concrete effects for gameplay. Some increase your cities' production, while others generate more wealth, and still others help create a more effective military. There are no right or wrong policy choices in the game, and one policy may be better for a given circumstance than another, or better suit your personal playing style. Try them out and see.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
