        Tiles under the clouds of the fog of war are totally unknown to you. You don't know what kind of terrain they are, who occupies them, or anything else. For all you know they may be flowing with gold or patrolled by ninja dinosaurs. You'd better get someone out to explore them as quickly as possible!
