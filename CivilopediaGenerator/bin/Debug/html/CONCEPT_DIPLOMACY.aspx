      Diplomacy is important in Civilization V. The world is huge and filled with other civilizations whose leaders are just as cunning and determined as you are. Some are honest; others are liars. Some are warlike and others prefer peace. But all want to win.<br /><br />You can accomplish a lot through diplomacy. You can gain allies and isolate your enemies. You can create defensive and offensive pacts. You can increase your technology through cooperative research ventures. You can end wars that are going badly for you. You can bluff the credulous and bully the timid.<br /><br />It's a big, tough world out there, and you won't last long if you automatically attack everybody you meet. Sometimes it really is better to talk than to fight - at least until their back is turned and you're ready to launch the big attack.
