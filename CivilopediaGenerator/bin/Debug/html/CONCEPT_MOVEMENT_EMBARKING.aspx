		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">At the start of the game, your land units cannot enter any water tiles. However, once you've learned the Optics technology, you can earn the promotion that allows land units to "embark" and move into coastal water tiles. To embark a unit, move the unit to a coastal tile and then click on the "Embark" Action. Once embarked, the unit must move into water. (Optics allows movement into coastal water only. The later Astronomy tech allows embarked units to enter ocean tiles.)<br /><br />In the water the embarked unit is very slow and almost helpless. It is able to defend itself to a certain degree, but it cannot attack and should not be left alone for too long on the open ocean. It's critical to accompany embarked land units with a strong naval defense.<br /><br />When the unit is adjacent to a land tile, you can click on the "Disembark" action. The unit will then be able to return to dry land. Alternatively you can right-click on a land tile and the unit will disembark automatically.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
