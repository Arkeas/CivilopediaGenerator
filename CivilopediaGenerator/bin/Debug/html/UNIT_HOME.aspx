										Units represent the more mobile aspects of your civilization, the workers who till the fields, the settlers who build new cities, the Great People who can singlehandedly change the course of a country through their genius or creativity. And of course units also represent your civ's military.<br /><br />Most units are built in your cities. Use them wisely. Always make sure that you have enough combat units to accomplish the military task at hand and to defend your cities, but don't overbuild, or the cost of supporting them will beggar your civ. Upgrade your military units when you can, but don't be shy about destroying them if you're overburdened. Similarly, have enough workers to handle the job, but they are expensive to maintain, so keep an eye on your finances.<br /><br />Whatever you do, early in the game send out units to explore the world! If you don't know what's going on in the world around you, you're liable to face some really ugly and possibly fatal surprises from greedy neighbors!
