        The city growth bucket contains all of the excess food produced by a city each turn. When the quantity of food reaches a specific amount, the city's population (citizens) will increase by 1; then the city growth bucket is emptied and the process begins all over again. The amount of food needed for population growth increases significantly as the city gets bigger.<br /><br />The City Info Box in the upper left-hand corner of the City Screen tells you how many turns until the city grows; and the "Food" entry in that box tells you how much food the city is currently producing each turn. Hover your cursor over the "Food" entry to see exactly how much food you need to fill the City Growth Bucket.
