		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">
        Combat occurs between two political entities that are at war with each other. A civilization may be at war with another civ or with a city-state. Barbarians are always at war with all civilizations and city-states.<br />There are three major forms of combat: melee, ranged, and air combat. The first two occur throughout most of the game, while air combat doesn't happen (naturally) until somebody discovers flight.<br /><br />Since it occurs so late in the game you needn't be concerned with how to conduct air combat when you begin play.
