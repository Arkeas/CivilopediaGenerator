        Air units do not move around the map like ground and naval units. They must be "based" on a player-owned friendly city. Fighters and some bombers can be based upon aircraft carriers as well. Missile units may be based on cities, nuclear submarines, and missile cruisers. Air units cannot embark. If on extended sea voyages, they must be carried by the appropriate vessel - carrier, cruiser, or nuclear sub.<br /><br />Anti-air units and helicopters don't need to be based. They move around the map like other units, and can embark.
