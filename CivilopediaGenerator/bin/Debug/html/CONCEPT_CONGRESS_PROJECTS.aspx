		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Some resolutions, rather than having immediate effects, begin what is known as an International Project. These resolutions cannot be repealed. International Projects, such as the World's Fair or the International Space Station, are collaborative efforts between all civilizations. Each civilization is able to contribute production towards the project by choosing it in the production list for their cities. Once the project receives enough production from civilizations, it is completed, and large rewards are distributed based on how much each civilization contributed. The highest level reward is always reserved for the civilization that contributed the most. There are also middle and bottom level rewards which are earned by meeting a certain threshold of contribution, depending on the project. Higher level rewards include all the lower level rewards as well, so the civilization that contributed the most will receive the highest, the middle, and the bottom rewards all together.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
