		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">After your spy has established surveillance in a target civilization, they will automatically start "Gathering Intelligence". If they discover that there are no technologies that you need, then you will receive a notification to let you know. You can then choose to move your spy to a better target, or instead leave your spy in the target civilization to watch for Intrigue. Intrigue is intercepted information that you can deliver to other civilizations. For example, you may have a spy in Arabia, and he may discover that they are planning to invade Egypt. You can then inform Egypt of this plot, and receive a diplomatic relationship boost as a result.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
