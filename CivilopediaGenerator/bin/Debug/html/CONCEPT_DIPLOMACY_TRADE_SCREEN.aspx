      The Trade Screen allows you to trade items, to make research agreements and to enter into other kinds of treaties. Many options require knowledge of certain technologies before you use them. If you cannot trade something, it is greyed out. Hover your cursor over a line to learn more about it.<br /><br />The Trade Screen is divided into two sides. Your civilization's stuff is on the right side, and the other civilization's is on the left.<br /><br />Click on items on your side to offer them to your trading partner; click on items on his or her side to indicate what you want in return. You might, for example, offer your opposite number "Open Borders" (permission for his units to enter your territory) in return for "Open Borders" (permission for your units to enter his territory).<br /><br />However, trades do not need to be equal: you can, for example, ask for "Open Borders" in return for gold, or nothing. Once you've set up the trade you want, click on the "Propose" button to present it to the other civilization. If the other civilization accepts the offer, it goes into effect immediately. If the other civilization rejects it, you click on "What would make this deal work?" to ask what the leader wants. (Note: there are times when the AI will never give up a certain item, no matter how tempting your offer is.)<br /><br />Sometimes the other leader will make you an offer. You can accept the offer or make a counter-offer or decline it altogether.<br /><br />Click on the "Exit" button to leave this screen.
