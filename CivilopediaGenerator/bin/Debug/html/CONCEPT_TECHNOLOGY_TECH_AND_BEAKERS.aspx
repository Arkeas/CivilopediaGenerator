        In Civilization V, each technology you acquire gives your civilization access to some advanced unit, building, resource or wonder, or gives you some other tangible benefit. Each new tech makes your civilization that much more powerful.<br /><br />You acquire technology by accumulating "beakers," which represent the amount of science your civilization possesses. Every turn your civilization gets a number of beakers added to its science pool. Each technology costs a certain number of beakers to learn; when you've accumulated enough beakers, you acquire the technology. When you get the new tech your beaker pool is depleted and you start accumulating all over again, saving up for the next tech.
