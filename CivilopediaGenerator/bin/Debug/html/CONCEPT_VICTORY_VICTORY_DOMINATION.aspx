        If you are the last player in possession of your own original capital you win. So if you capture all other civs' capitals and hang onto your own, you've achieved victory. However, this can be tricky. Suppose you're in a five-player game and you capture three of your opponents' original capitals, but the fifth player sneaks in and captures your capital while you're not paying attention - then he would win immediately. In other words, it doesn't matter who captures what: it's the last player holding onto his original capital who gets the victory.<br /><br />If you've lost your original capital, but still possess other cities, you can still win another type of victory: culture, scientific, diplomatic, or time. However, you cannot win a domination victory until and unless you recapture your own original capital.
