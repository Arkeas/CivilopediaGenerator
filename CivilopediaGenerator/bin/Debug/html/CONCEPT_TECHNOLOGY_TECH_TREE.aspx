        To see how all of this works in the game, check out the amazing Technology Tree. It displays all of the technologies and shows how they are intertwined. You can click on a tech to order your civilization to research it - if your civilization doesn't know the prerequisite techs it will research them as well. The Tech Tree will plot the quickest route to the requested tech, and you will research the necessary precursors in the order it displays.  The Tech Tree can be reached from the Choose Research menu and by pressing the F5 hotkey.
