		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Generally, units move from hex to hex, paying the "Movement Cost" required to enter the new hex. Units are subject to "Stacking" limitations - two military units may not end their turn in the same hex, nor can two non-military units, but one military and one non-military unit may end their turn stacked in the same hex. Note that embarked military units, as well as Great Generals and Great Admirals, are all considered non-military, and can be stacked with a military unit for protection.<br /><br />Most units are limited in where they can move - land units cannot enter mountain hexes and naval units cannot enter land hexes (except for port cities). Improvements like roads and railroads speed a unit's movement through land hexes.<br /><br />Check out the section on Movement for details.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
