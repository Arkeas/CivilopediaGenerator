		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Great Generals are "Great People" skilled in the art of warfare. They provide combat bonuses - offensive and defensive bonuses both - to any friendly land units within two tiles of their location. A Great General itself is a non-combat unit, so it may be stacked with a combat unit for protection. If an enemy unit ever enters the tile containing a Great General, the General is destroyed.<br /><br />A Great General gives a combat bonus of 15% to units in the General's tile and all friendly land units within 2 tiles of the General.<br /><br />Great Generals are created when your units have been in battle and also can be acquired when you unlock the "Warrior Code" social policy. See the section on "Great People" for more details.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
