		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">Happiness is a measure of your citizens' contentment. As a rule, the larger your total population, the unhappier everybody gets. An unhappy population doesn't grow very rapidly, and a very unhappy population will affect the fighting quality of your armies as well.<br /><br />Your civ's happiness is displayed on the status line of the Main Screen (in the upper left-hand corner of the game). Watch it carefully. If it reaches zero, your population is getting restless. If it starts to dip into negative numbers, you're in trouble. (Incidentally, you can get an excellent snapshot of your population's happiness by hovering your cursor over this number.)<br /><br />One important note to remember - happiness generated from city buildings and city-based policies can never exceed that city's population. For example, if a city is generating 5 happiness from buildings and a garrison, but only has 3 population, then only 3 happiness will be added to your total.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
