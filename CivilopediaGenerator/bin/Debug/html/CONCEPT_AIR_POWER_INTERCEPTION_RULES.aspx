        Fighters and jet fighters can be set to "intercept" enemy air attacks.  (AA gun, mobile SAM, and certain naval units automatically intercept; they don't need to be given a special mission.) If an air unit tries an air strike against a target within the range of an intercepting unit, the interceptor will fire on the attacker and do damage to it. Unless the attacker is killed by the interceptor, the air strike proceeds.<br /><br />Only one unit can intercept an air strike, and once it does so, it cannot intercept any more that turn (though certain promotions can increase this). So if you're expecting multiple air attacks on a target, you might want to pile multiple fighters and AA units on and around that target.
