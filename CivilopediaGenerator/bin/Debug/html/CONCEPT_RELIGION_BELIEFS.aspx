		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">When you found a Pantheon or when you later in the game found or enhance a Religion there are a number of different slots you can fill with a selection of Beliefs. The types of Beliefs you get to select are Pantheon Beliefs, Founder Beliefs, Follower Beliefs and Enhancer Beliefs. There are Civilizations that, due to their unique trait, get to choose an additional Bonus Belief.<br /><br />Beliefs are picked on a first come first serve basis. When any Belief has been picked it will not be available for any other Civilization which is founding or enhancing their Religion afterwards. This makes being the first to get to this point very valuable.<br /><br />A full list of all the different Beliefs can be found in the Religion section of the Civilopedia.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
