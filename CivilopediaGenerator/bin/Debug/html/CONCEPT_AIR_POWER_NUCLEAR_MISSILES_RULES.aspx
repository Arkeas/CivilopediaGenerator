        While the atomic bomb does a fair amount of damage, nuclear missiles are truly devastating. All units caught in the blast radius are destroyed, and the damage done to cities is even greater. Unlike atomic bombs, nuclear missiles are even capable of wiping cities off the map completely (note that a player's original capital may not be destroyed in this manner).<br /><br />As their name implies, nuclear missiles are missile units, which means they may be stationed on missile cruisers or nuclear submarines, but not aircraft carriers.
