        Cities may be attacked and captured by enemy units. Each city has a "defensive value" which is determined by the city's location, its size, whether any military units are "garrisoned" in that city, and whether defensive buildings such as walls have been constructed in the city. The higher the city's defensive value, the harder it is to capture the city. Unless the city is extremely weak or the attacking unit is extremely strong, it will take multiple units multiple turns to capture a city. See the section on Combat for details on warfare in general.
