		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">There are six types of non-combat units: Settlers, Workers, Work Boats, Great People, Spaceship Parts, and Religious Units. Each is critically important to a civilization's success. As the name "non-combat" would suggest, these units cannot fight. If attacked by an enemy unit while alone in a hex they are automatically captured or destroyed. Therefore it usually makes sense to escort them with a military unit when sending them out into the wilderness.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
