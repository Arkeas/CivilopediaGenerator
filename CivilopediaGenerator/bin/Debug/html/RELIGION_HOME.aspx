										Religion - as embodied in the great faiths of the world - has been one of the most significant factors in the progress of Man's culture and history. Religion has been the foundation for great art, wonders, and unity, but also has been the source of wars and intolerance. In Civilization V, religion brings your people advantages in the form of "Beliefs" that will further distinguish your civilization from others.<br /><br />From the selection of the simple, single tenet of a "Pantheon" through the development of a sophisticated "Enhanced Religion," it is important for your success to make wise choices in the faith your civilization will follow. As rendered by "Faith" points, Great Prophets, Missionaries, Inquisitors, Holy Sites, and religious buildings in your cities can greatly aid your progress towards victory.
