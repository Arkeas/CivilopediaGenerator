		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">
        There are three kinds of Wonders in the game: National Wonders, World Wonders, and Project Wonders. Each civilization may construct a single copy of a National Wonder (in other words, each civ may build one National Epic, but no civ may build two). Projects work exactly the same as National Wonders. Only one of each World Wonder may be constructed anywhere in the world: once one civ has constructed one, no other civ may do so. Wonders will disappear from the City Build Menu once you can no longer construct them.<br /><br />If another civ completes construction of a World Wonder while you are building it, you will receive a gold bonus to compensate you for your efforts, and you'll have to begin construction on something else.<br /><br />See the section on Wonders for more details.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
