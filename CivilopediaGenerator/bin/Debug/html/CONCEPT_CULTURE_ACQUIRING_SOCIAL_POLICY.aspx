        You acquire social policies based upon the total amount of culture produced by all of your cities. Check out the Status Bar at the top of the Main screen to see how much total culture your civ has accumulated, how much culture the civ is producing each turn, and how much is required before getting a new social policy.<br /><br />When you have accumulated enough culture, you can go to the Social Policies Screen and buy a new policy. (See the section on Social Policies for details.) Each time you purchase a new social policy the price of the next one increases.
