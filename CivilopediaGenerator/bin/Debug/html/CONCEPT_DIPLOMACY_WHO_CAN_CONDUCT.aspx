      You can speak to a city-state or another civilization's leader at any time after you've established diplomatic relations with them. This happens automatically when one of your cities or units encounters one of their cities or units. (In fact, the desire to establish diplomatic relations is one of the driving forces behind world exploration.) After you've established diplomatic relations with another political entity you can speak with them at any time - though they may not have much to say if they hate your guts.<br /><br />Note that another civilization or city-state may attempt to open negotiations with you, as well, after you've opened diplomatic relations.
