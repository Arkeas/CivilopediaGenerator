        Workers represent the men and women who build your empire. They clear the jungles and build the farms which feed your cities. They dig the mines that provide you with precious gold and mighty iron. They lay the roads which connect your cities. Although they are not military units, workers are important.<br /><br />Improvements increase the production, gold, and/or food output of tiles. They also provide access to the special bonuses provided by certain resources. If you do not improve your land, your civilization will almost certainly be overwhelmed by others which have.
