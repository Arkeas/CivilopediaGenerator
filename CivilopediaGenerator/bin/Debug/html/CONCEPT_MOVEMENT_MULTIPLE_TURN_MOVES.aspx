        If the unit requires multiple turns to reach the location, it will pick the shortest route and proceed on its way. It will continue to move each turn until it gets to the assigned spot.<br /><br />If it becomes impossible for the unit to reach its assigned location - say, because exploration reveals that the tile is across the ocean and the moving unit can't embark, or perhaps because another unit has sat down in the target location - the unit will stop and request new orders.<br />You can change a unit's orders at any time by clicking on the unit and then either giving it new orders or clicking on the "Cancel Orders" action.
