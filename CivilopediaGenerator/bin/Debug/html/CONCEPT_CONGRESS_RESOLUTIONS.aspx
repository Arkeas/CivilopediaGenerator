		<h2>Summary:</h2><div class="t"><div class="b"><div class="l"><div class="r"><div class="bl"><div class="br"><div class="tl"><div class="tr">A resolution is a change to the game world that is proposed to and decided by the civilizations of the World Congress. For example, a resolution can embargo trade routes with a certain civilization, increase the culture from Wonders, prevent the construction of nuclear weapons, or award someone Diplomatic Victory. A resolution may also repeal a previously passed resolution, reversing its effects. <br /><br />Only two civilizations get to propose resolutions: the current host of the Congress, and the other player who has the most delegates.<br /><br />All civilizations get to help decide the outcome of proposed resolutions once the Congress is in session. They do so by allocating their delegates towards the outcome they desire: "Yea" to help it pass or "Nay" to help it fail. Some resolutions require choosing a civilization rather than simply "Yea" or "Nay".<br /><br />Once all civilizations have used their delegates, the resolution's outcome is decided by whichever option received the most delegate support. If there is a tie, the resolution fails.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
