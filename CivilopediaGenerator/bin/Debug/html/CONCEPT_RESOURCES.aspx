        Resources are sources of food, productivity, or culture, or they provide other special bonuses to a civilization. To a large degree your civilization's wealth and power will be determined by the number and kinds of resources you control. To utilize a resource, it must be within your civilization's borders and you must construct the appropriate "improvement" in that hex. (For example, you must construct the "plantation" improvement to get the benefit from a "banana" resource.)<br /><br />There are three different kinds of resources: bonus, strategic and luxury. All three provide yield benefits to nearby cities, and strategic and luxury resources have additional important benefits.<br /><br />While you may not have access to every kind of resource within your own borders, you can trade some resources with other civilizations.
